# Queue Data Structure

## Defination

<br />

### A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

<br/>

## Operations

  1. ### isFull() / isEmpty()
     ### These are helper functions to check wether a queue is full/empty. These functions are not specific to this data structure but these and simillar functions makes interacting to these data structures much more easy for programmer <strong>Time Complexity is: O(1) </strong> 

  <br/>

  2. ### Dequeue()
     ### Dequeue function is one of two major operations that can be performed on Queue data structure, this operation <strong> removes an element from the beginning of the queue </strong>
