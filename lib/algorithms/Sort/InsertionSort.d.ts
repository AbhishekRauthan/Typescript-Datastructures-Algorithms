/**
 * Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm.
 * The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
 *
 * Implementation of Insertion sort for number array.
 *
 * Time Complexity: Best -> O(n); Worst -> O(n^2)
 * @param sortArray an unsorted array
 * @returns a sorted array
